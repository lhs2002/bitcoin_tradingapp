# Project Description
Crypto Trading Assistant
A web application that allows trading of cryptocurrencies.

## Detailed Description
Using the exchange's API, this trading program will allow the submission of trading orders, including stop losses and profit taking limits. In the case of stop losses, since exchanges currently cannot accept these, the program will store these orders and only submit a market sell order to exchange when price hit the stop price. 

Additional features may include recording of P&L per trade and over time, as well as balances, user login and registration, withdrawal of currencies to wallet.

# Where Hosted
not sure yet

# Goals

## Good
A minimal version of the program would involve 1) the successful submission of buy and sell orders, including the stop losses 2) Show existing opened trades and past trades

## Better
In addition to features in GOOD outcome, to have ability to record the P&L of trades, probably to export as csv.

## Best
In addition to features in BETTER outcome, to have 1) ability to withdraw currencies to specified wallets, 2) user login, settings and registration

# Next Steps and Questions

In terms of API, to research into RESTful API and API documentation of the identified exchange to identify required features and limitations (request limits etc). 

In general, to study into the topic of trade bots development using python. While there is no need to have automated algo trades in this program, the knowledge on data flows using API should be applicable.
