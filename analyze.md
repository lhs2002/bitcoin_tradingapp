# Analyze This

## Questions

1a. Correct, cards are sorted in ascending order from smallest to largest number.

1b. O(n.log n) since its a merge sort.

2a. Yes, its an alternate bubble sort called shaker sort, which searches bidirectional.

2b. The upper limit is O(n^2). The complexity in worst case scenario is equivalent to bubble sort.

3a. Yes, but may just continue with search instead of shuffling.

3b. O(n) since its a linear search.
