## Questions

5.1. CSV is more compact in terms of file size and is perhaps more convenient to read due to the wide use of excel spreadsheets.

5.2. JSON is better at showing hierarchical data.

5.3. https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=NFLX&interval=1min&apikey=NAJXWIA8D6VN6A3K&datatype=csv
     (Note: As per alphavantage API guide https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#intraday. But somehow there isnt any data )

5.4. (Note:Invalid API call error for link provided in quiz question. For purpose of completing this question, I referred to alphavantage json screenshot in http://www.the-data-wrangler.com/graphing-stock-da
     Field Names within the json file consists of numbered bullets, which is unnecessary and makes accessing of the data object error-prone. An improvement would be to remove the numbered bullets and just have the Fields names,
     which are descriptive enough on their own.
