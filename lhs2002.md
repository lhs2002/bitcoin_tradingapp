## Name
Lok Hong Sum (lokhongsum@gmail.com)

## What have you done so far?
Setup and review sandbox environment at exchange. (ie creation of API keys, user entitlements, download documentations)

Made websocket request function to pull public data (latest prices) and private user specific data(balances, open orders and trade history)

Made app routes and functions in python to manipulate data and display in html pages.

Made jinja templates and some css to present information.



## What have you not yet done?
CSS styling for all webpages, implement functions to 1) place buy/sell orders and 2) place stop losses. Database/ an array of dict to be created to store stop loss orders when they are placed, and call place-order function when latest price hit stop loss price level.

## What problems have you encountered?
Formatting of the json data received from exchange. (eg. timestamp in epoch format etc, deleting irrelevant dictionary keys and renaming the rest)- Has been resolved. 

Not sure if the proposed solution to implement stop loss is the best/most efficient.
