# To be or not to be

## ~~That is the question~~ These are the questions

4.1. 1000

4.2. update_fitness compares each character of gene string with the targeted 18 characters Shakespearean string. (ie 1st char vs 1st char, 2nd vs 2nd etc) For every match, score is increased by 1, starting from 0.
     A final score is calculated as score divided by 18.

4.3. 0.056

4.4. An inverse relationship could be established between edit distance and fitness. (eg. fitness score = 1/edit distance)

4.5. In some cases, both parent strings may not have the required character/s in a particular position such that subsequent generations will never reach the targeted outcome.
     The mutation provides a way to modify the child string to include the required character/s for future iterations.
